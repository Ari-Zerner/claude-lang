# Working notes: state and next step

Read this first when picking the project up cold. IDEA.md is the brief; DESIGN.md has the
design and its decisions (D1...).

## Log
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 1): wrote DESIGN.md with design principles, decisions D1-D12 and
  open questions. No code yet.
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 2): first working compiler, `clc.py` (~1300 lines, Python -> C ->
  gcc). It covers Int/Bool, `let`/`var`, assignment, `if`/`else if`/`else`, `while`, `return`,
  `print`, calls with named arguments, `uses io` effect checking, examples run on every build
  (D8), named closers with recovery (D2), D6 precedence errors, word error codes (D14),
  other-language hints (D15), checked overflow and division (D16), and `--json` diagnostics.
  `tests/run.py`: 8 tests (2 running programs, 6 error files), all passing. Builds take ~0.15 s.
  Added DESIGN D13-D17 and a README.
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 3): wrote SPEC.md (~1.2k tokens, well under D11's 4k budget; every
  complete program in it is now a test). Built `trials/trial.py`: it gives a fresh headless
  `claude -p` (no tools) only SPEC.md and a task, compiles the answer, and on failure hands back
  the diagnostics for one fix. First run (Sonnet, 6 small numeric tasks): **6/6 compiled and
  printed the right answer on the first try**, and Sonnet wrote `example` lines in nearly every
  function unprompted (26 lines across 6 programs). Results in `trials/results/`. That's
  encouraging, but the tasks were too easy to find weaknesses, and the fix path never ran.

## Next step
1. Harder trial tasks that push on what's missing or easy to get wrong, to see what Claude reaches
   for: early exit from a loop (no `break`), nested loops, mutual recursion, a task that tempts
   string output (a table), a task where named-argument order matters (three or more parameters),
   and helper functions that print (tests `uses io`). Then fix the spec or language based on what
   breaks. Also try Haiku: a weaker model finds spec gaps sooner.
2. Holes (D9).
3. Strings, then lists (decide memory management first: see the open question).
4. A formatter (D12).

Known gaps: no `break`; the `.cl` extension clashes with OpenCL, so the name is still provisional.

Public: https://github.com/Ari-Zerner/claude-lang (Ari, 2026-11-05). Push after each commit.

## How to build/test
`python3 tests/run.py`; under the box's memory cap:
`systemd-run --scope -q -p MemoryMax=400M -- python3 tests/run.py`.
