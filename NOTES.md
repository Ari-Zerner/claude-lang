# Working notes: state and next step

Read this first when picking the project up cold. IDEA.md is the brief; DESIGN.md has the
design and its decisions (D1...).

## Log
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 1): wrote DESIGN.md with design principles, decisions D1-D12 and
  open questions. No code yet.
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 2): first working compiler, `clc.py` (~1300 lines, Python -> C ->
  gcc). It covers Int/Bool, `let`/`var`, assignment, `if`/`else if`/`else`, `while`, `return`,
  `print`, calls with named arguments, `uses io` effect checking, examples run on every build
  (D8), named closers with recovery (D2), D6 precedence errors, word error codes (D14),
  other-language hints (D15), checked overflow and division (D16), and `--json` diagnostics.
  `tests/run.py`: 8 tests (2 running programs, 6 error files), all passing. Builds take ~0.15 s.
  Added DESIGN D13-D17 and a README.
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 3): wrote SPEC.md (~1.2k tokens, well under D11's 4k budget; every
  complete program in it is now a test). Built `trials/trial.py`: it gives a fresh headless
  `claude -p` (no tools) only SPEC.md and a task, compiles the answer, and on failure hands back
  the diagnostics for one fix. First run (Sonnet, 6 small numeric tasks): **6/6 compiled and
  printed the right answer on the first try**, and Sonnet wrote `example` lines in nearly every
  function unprompted (26 lines across 6 programs). Results in `trials/results/`. That's
  encouraging, but the tasks were too easy to find weaknesses, and the fix path never ran.
- 2026-11-05 (night 1, step 4): harder trial set (`--set hard`: early exit with no `break`,
  mutual recursion, a 3-parameter function, a printing helper, coin change with no lists, a table
  that can't be printed on one line). **Sonnet and Haiku both got all 7 checkable tasks right on
  the first try**, so across three runs it's 20/20, with zero compile errors. Observations:
  - Missing `break`: both used a `found` flag in the loop condition. It works, but it's verbose.
  - Missing strings: Sonnet noticed the table can't go on one line, said so in a comment and
    printed one number per line. Neither invented string syntax, so the spec's line "if it isn't
    described here, it doesn't exist" works.
  - Missing lists: Haiku did coin change with four nested loops.
  - Models name single arguments too (`divisors(t: triangular(n: n))`), which the spec allows.

## Next step
Writing small programs from the spec is evidently easy, so the trials should move to the parts
that haven't been tested:
1. **Fix-loop trial (tests D10, the diagnostics).** Take the correct trial programs, inject the
   typical mistakes (swap named arguments, drop an `end if`, `&&`, a missing `uses io`, reusing a
   name, `elif`, an off-by-one caught by an example) and check whether a fresh model given only
   SPEC.md plus the compiler output fixes it in one go. Compare against a variant that gets only
   the bare first line of each error (no source line or `fix:`) to see whether the extra text earns
   its tokens.
2. **Bigger programs** (~100+ lines, several interacting functions), where the locality claims
   (D2, D4, D17) should matter more.
3. Language: strings and printing without a newline are the most-felt gap; `break` second.
   Holes (D9) and the formatter (D12) after that.

Known gaps: no `break`; the `.cl` extension clashes with OpenCL, so the name is still provisional.
